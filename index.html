                <p>Starting locally, <b>Green Ways</b> promotes environmentally friendly and sustainable ways that we can live, 
                with the aim of conserving the planet for all inhabitants.</p>
                <p>We run <b>'Waste Not'</b>, a Reading-based project to receive and recycle unwanted items. 
                We want to reduce expenditure for all, to reduce emissions on production and unnecessary travel to shops, 
                and to support community.</p> 
                <p>We aim to support and develop sustainable, low-carbon alternatives to the current consumerist and 
                growth-based paradigm. We link our local environmental work to what is happening globally to our planet.</p>

          <h3>Our next open day is Sunday 29 April, 12:00 to 16:00 see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GreenWaysUK">facebook</a> for details</h3>
          <p>Many items that we buy for ourselves, our home and our children are already available and unwanted in our communities. 
          At the Green Ways Hub at 13a Southview Park, Caversham RG4 5AF, you can:</p>
          <ul><li><p><b>● find free items that you need.</b> This can be anything; saucepans, books, wellies, coffee tables, clothing, birthday cards.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>● donate unwanted items</b>, including items that charity shops are not usually taking such as floorboards, pieces of insulation, 
          all the items that end up in the bin or at the local tip. We take most things except sofas and white goods. 
          If an item is large please email or DM us ahead to check that we have space for the item.</p></li> 
          <li><p><b>● can respond to and make requests</b> for items from the community (eg I need a shelf bracket, dog bed, radiator key etc).</p></li></ul><br>
          <p>The household items that we gather are also redistributed through partnerships with local refugee organisations and charities 
          supporting people affected by domestic violence.  We are happy to take referrals.</p>
          <p>As we develop further, we plan to create a local resource of items such as quality garden tools, carpet cleaners and other items 
          that can be loaned - removing the need for people to buy and store their own equipment.</p><br>
          <p>The statistics on waste and recycling in the UK highlight the urgent need to create a functioning 
          system to share resources, reduce consumerism and live more sustainably:</p>
          <ul><li><p><b>● UK households throw away 155,000 tonnes of domestic electrical waste</b> annually, hoarding nearly 20 small old electrical 
          items per household. (<a href="https://recycle-more.co.uk">Recycle-More.co.uk</a>).</p></li>
          <li><p><b>● The UK has the highest consumption of new clothing in Europe</b>, with the average person buying 26.7kg of new clothes each year. 
          The average lifetime for a piece of clothing is estimated to be 2.2 years leading to around 300,000 tonnes of used 
          clothes either being burned or sent to landfills on an annual basis.</p></li></ul><br>
          <p>This initiative is a complement to, and is not intended to replace, valuable and successful established initiatives 
          such as Freegle, Freecycle, the multiple Facebook Groups and Buy Nothing Networks etc.</p>
          <p>Green Ways uses several of these networks to offer items when we are running out of space in the Hub. 
          Our own community research has shown that some people may struggle to access free items available online: 
          they may have no transport/access to the internet, or cannot meet the deadline requested.</p><br>
          <p>When people are offering items, they may need the items gone as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Charity shops are becoming more mindful of what they receive as the costs of disposal increase.</p>
          <p>The 'Waste Not' free shop is another way to acquire free items and to dispose of items that are no longer needed.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Recycling Other Items</h2>
          <h3>Selected Household Rubbish</h3>
          <p>As we grow, we aim to offer more general recycling opportunities for household rubbish, including those items that
             are not recycled as part of local authority collections. Currently we are collecting:</p>
          <div class="owl-carousel owl-theme owl-loaded owl-drag">
            <div><img src="image/recycle-bra.png" >
            <h3>Unwanted Bras</h3>
            <p>We collect bras which are given to local charity Stepping Forward 
              (<a href="htps://www.stepping-forward.org.uk/">www.stepping-forward.org.uk</a>); 
              these are sent to mothers of disabled children in Sierra Leone who sell them to generate an income. 
              Bras are not made locally in Sierra Leone and can generate a reasonable income for mothers who are 
              struggling to balance work and their caring responsibilities.</p>
            </div>
            <div><img src="image/recycle-glasses.png">
              <h3>Sunglasses and Hats</h3>
              <p>We also collect sunglasses, hats and long-sleeved shirts for people with albinism in Sierra Leone 
                through a partnership with the Sierra Leone Association of People With Albinism.</p>
              <p>We are able to send these items free of charge with the support of a shipping company.</p>
            </div>
            <div><img src="image/battery_recycling.png">
              <h3>Batteries</h3>
              <p>Batteries contain toxic chemicals, such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and nickel, that can contaminate soil 
                and water when not disposed of correctly. These chemicals can harm wildlife, pollute water sources, and 
                accumulate in the food chain, posing a threat to ecosystems and human health. Recycling batteries is the 
                responsible way to dispose of them, as it allows for the extraction of valuable materials and reduces the 
                risk of environmental pollution.</p>
            </div>
            <div><img src="image/printers-cartridge.png">
              <h3>Printer Cartridges</h3>
              <p>Printer cartridges, includeing laser cartriges, are made of a combination of plastic, metal, and ink, and 
                when not disposed of correctly, they can end up in landfills, contributing to pollution and waste. Recycling 
                printer cartridges helps conserve resources, reduce energy consumption, and prevent unnecessary landfill 
                waste. Many printer cartridges can be refilled or remanufactured, reducing the need for new cartridges and 
                conserving raw materials.

      <section id="climate" class="work-area">
        <div class="container">
          <h2 class="section-header">About Us & Climate Change</h2>
          <p>We are a community group run by volunteers and are based at 13a Southview Park, Caversham, Reading RG4 5AF</p>
          <p>We would love to hear from you if you would like to know more, to volunteer or if you have ideas for 
            collaboration on environmental issues – or if you just want to make contact.</p>
          <p><b>Climate change is affecting every aspect of our lives and we are not doing enough to curb our emissions.</b></p>
          <p>The March 2023 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s confirmed what was largely already known: every 
            bit of warming matters. The warmer the planet gets, the greater and more severe the changes in both average 
            climate and climate and weather extremes. These affect our food, our water, the safety of our homes, our own 
            health, our economy, and the natural environment. And globally those who have contributed least to the problem 
            are the ones paying most of the costs. Right now millionaires alone are projected to burn more than 70% of the 
            remaining carbon budget for 1.5C.</p>
          <p>The IPCC report is clear that there is hope; but we need to understand the detail of the emergency and react 
            accordingly – transforming our societies and doing so at speed.</p>
          <p>We already have many of the solutions we need to tackle this issue – and the required changes will benefit 
            us in multiple ways. Climate solutions including efficiency, clean energy, regenerative agriculture, and green 
            infrastructure increase our resilience and accelerate the transition to a clean energy future while simultaneously 
            improving health, animal welfare, equity, justice, and economic concerns.</p>
          <p>We may not want to hear about the three areas where individually we can make the greatest impact on carbon emissions: 
            going vegan, going car less and stopping long haul flights (New York Times 15 December 2022).  But it is 
            important that we know the impact of our actions collectively and individually.</p>
          <p>As a matter of great urgency, we need to change how we see nature and our place in it, shifting from a philosophy 
            of domination and extraction to one that's rooted in reciprocity and regeneration. We need to evolve to a new 
            system that is fit for the 21st century, an economy that enables human flourishing while reversing ecological 
            breakdown. ‘By taking less, we can become more’ (Jason Hickel).</p><br>
